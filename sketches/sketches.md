#Procedure

Evaluate each idea by ranking (or grouping) by attractiveness, attach reasons if there are multiple aspects you see. Most scribbles are nonsens, but excluding definite losers helps finding interesting notions and elaborate on them in the next iteration.

The following grouping is by subject to improve overview.

#01-07

Somebody on the issue tracker said "helmet", so the approach was just trying different helmets and sometimes blending the initial letters in.

#08-09

Looking at the crowned guy on the cover image, I replaced his face with the initials.

#10

After recently reading something on The Open Group, there occurred some brain short circuit. Optionally imagine using textured surfaces for the letter elements.

#11-18

Inspired by the tech tree graphics, the idea is to promote the logo as an escutcheon. Typography is supposed to be antique. Proposals range from frugal with few details and texture to rich with lots of material properties and tiny decorative elements.

#20-27

Purely typographical experiments, combining the inital letters in different ways with different styles. 21 is more of a joke.

#28-30

Without really liking the kind of Mickey-Mousing Apple did there, some approaches to vaguely hide the typography in theme-related objects.

#31

Trying to find the most stereotypic helmet silhouette.

#32-33

Some variations on the Omega theme with written out "age".

#34-35

Abstracting the helmet into an icon together with some variants.

#36

Crossover with the Open Source Initiative logo.

#37

Added a little shape so the negative space resembles a helmet.

#38

Combinations of the previous ideas.

#39-41

Variations on the circle-enclosed negative. Typography is only placeholder.

#42
Combination of lots of the above. Here you have a little shield-shape in the middle and a negative-space head with a crown that is surrounded by an Open `O`.

#43
Picking up on the antique helmet subject again, now combined with the round frame.

#44
Ideas on typography. Though ancient writing is fascinating, trying to transform it into readable latin glyphs is goes nowhere here, I think.

#45
Plain old classical latin script, sort of like the original AOE.

#46
Bringig together the new helmet theme and some letters.

#47
Another take on the medieval helmet (see 34), getting more abstract.

#48
Here is a relatively new idea, picking up the concept of rhombic tiles. At the end I tried to bring it together with the Open `O`.

#49-54
More iteration on the tiles theme.
